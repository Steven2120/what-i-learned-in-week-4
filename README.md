# What I Learned In Week 4

## **Const and Let**
  Const and let are two different way to initiate variables. There are differences however. The values of const variables should not be changed. So if you define a variable that you know will not be changed, you should use conts. For almost everything else use let.
## **Functions**
  Functions were also introduced in week 4. Functions are very useful for helping you be efficient with your code. Instead of coding certain lines of code that will serve a certain purpose, if you create a function with that same purpose, all you have to do is call the function whenever you need that specific command executed. 
## **Parameters and Arguments**
  Functions can be equipped with parameters. Parameters are entered inside the function parenthesis. they are variables that are defined and are used inside the function. Always try to name the parameters in relation to the argument. When you call the function instead of entering the parameter inside the parethesis, you would enter the argument.

## **Conclusion**
  After another week of continuing to learn Javascript, we are starting to see just how powerful it is. We started to get into if statements which work with booleans and work hand in hand with functions.
